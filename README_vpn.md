# How to play `sm64ex-coop` with ZeroTier VPN on Android

This guide is for anyone who can't port forward, like cell data users. A "host" needs to create an account and invite "guests", players who join. This example shows what each person needs to do at every step. The steps for the "host" are in the left column, while what the "guest" should do at the same time is in the right column. Once everyone is connected to ZeroTier, technically anyone can use the "Host" button in the actual `sm64ex-coop` app, but for simplicity the "host" will do it in this example. **Warning: the ZeroTier One app for Android is proprietary**, but for updates on that status, self-hosting, alternative builds and partial source code, follow [this project](https://github.com/kaaass/ZerotierFix).
